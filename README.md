# Apex Legends Superglide Trainer: Meaty Edition

This fork provides the same functionality as the [original version](https://github.com/AngryGroceries/Apex_Superglide_Practice_Tool) while adding the convenience of not having to launch a PowerShell instance and copy the code manually every time you wish to run the script. It also saves your settings between reloads, fixes a minor bug, and features a neat icon.

Additional credits:

Mokeysniper @ https://www.youtube.com/@Mokeysniper for giving permission to use his icon from the [web version](https://apexmovement.tech/superglidetrainer/) of the Apex Legends Superglide Trainer. It's a great tool, slightly held back in terms of precision by the limitations of browsers. Highly recommended for the various explanations provided on that page as well.


## How to use

1. Download the file ALST_ME_vX.X.zip from the newest release in the [Releases section](https://github.com/Meatninja/Apex_Legends_Superglide_Trainer_Meaty_Edition/releases). Please note: do NOT press Code -> Download ZIP on the main page, and do NOT download the source code. Just get the .zip file from Releases. This shouldn't matter much right now, but might matter in future versions.
2. Extract the contents of the .zip file (it contains 1 appropriately named folder) into the root of your C drive (that is, directly into "C:"). When done, all files should be in "C:\Apex Legends Superglide Trainer".
3. (optional) Move the shortcut (the shortcut is called "Apex Legends Superglide Trainer" and has a green arrow as its icon) from the extracted folder to your desktop.
4. Run the shortcut. Don't try to run the .ps1 file, the .bat file or anything else. Whenever you want to run the script again in the future, you just have to run the shortcut again.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions within the window that appears. This tool is meant to be used *within the script's window*, not in Apex Legends itself. If nothing happens when you run the shortcut or you get some kind of error, follow the Troubleshooting steps below.

## Troubleshooting

If issues arise, they're probably related to your PowerShell configuration. You can try the following steps:

1. Install [PowerShell 7.4](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.4.0/PowerShell-7.4.0-win-x64.msi). If you don't know what to choose in a certain step of the installation process, pick the default options. This step is usually enough to fix the problem.
2. If you're still encountering problems, it's probably an [execution policy issue](https://adamtheautomator.com/run-powershell-script/). Follow the instructions from that page to change your PowerShell execution policy to whichever one you choose.

## Additional notes

Pressing "Ctrl + C" within the script's window will terminate (exit) the script, or you can exit out of the window by simply clicking the X in the top right.
