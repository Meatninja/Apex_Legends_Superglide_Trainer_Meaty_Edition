# Apex Legends Superglide Trainer: Meaty Edition

This fork provides the same functionality as the original version https://github.com/AngryGroceries/Apex_Superglide_Practice_Tool while adding the convenience of not having to run a PowerShell instance manually every time you wish to run the script. It also saves your settings between reloads, fixes a minor bug, and features a neat icon.

Additional credits:

Mokeysniper @ https://www.youtube.com/@Mokeysniper for giving permission to use his icon from the web version of the superglide trainer https://apexmovement.tech/superglidetrainer/ - It's a great tool, slightly held back in terms of precision by the limitations of browsers. Highly recommended for the various explanations provided on that page as well.


## How to use:

1. Download the file ALST_ME_vX.X.zip from the newest release in the Releases tab https://github.com/Meatninja/Apex_Legends_Superglide_Trainer_Meaty_Edition/releases

2. Extract the contents of the .zip file (it contains 1 appropriately named folder) into the root of your C drive. When done, all files should be in "C:\Apex Legends Superglide Trainer\".

3. (optional) Move the shortcut (the shortcut is called "Apex Legends Superglide Trainer" and has a green arrow as its icon) from the extracted folder to your desktop.

4. Run the shortcut. Done.


For now only tested on my own PC. If issues arise, they're probably related to your PowerShell configuration. Try installing the newest version https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4#installing-the-msi-package and if that still doesn't work, it's probably an execution policy issue https://adamtheautomator.com/run-powershell-script/


Pressing "Ctrl + C" within the PowerShell window will terminate the script when you are finished, or you can exit out of PowerShell by clicking the X in the top right of the window.
